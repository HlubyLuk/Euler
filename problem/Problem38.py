    Pandigital multiples
    Problem 38
    Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:

    192 Ã— 1 = 192
    192 Ã— 2 = 384
    192 Ã— 3 = 576

    By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We
    will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)

    The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4,
    and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product
    of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).

    What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as
    the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1?
